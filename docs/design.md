# Design Guidelines

## Visual Style

- Aesthetic: Premium dark glassmorphism — frosted translucent panels floating on a deep near-black canvas, organized into a dense bento dashboard grid
- Mood: Expensive, calm, high-trust, futuristic — money that feels engineered, not corporate
- Inspiration: High-end banking / crypto wallet apps — Revolut, Arc, Linear-dark, holographic card marketing sites
- Signature element: An iridescent holographic payment card anchoring the top of the screen

## Color Palette

- Background: #080B14 — deepest page background, blue-black undertone (never pure #000000, never warm)
- Background Alt: #0C1019 — secondary background zones
- Surface / Card: rgba(255,255,255,0.04) — glass fill. Raised/nested: 0.06. Hover/active: 0.08. Never solid.
- Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.08) — 1px on every glass surface. Hover: rgba(255,255,255,0.14)
- Text Primary: rgba(255,255,255,0.95) — numbers, headings
- Text Secondary: rgba(255,255,255,0.62) — labels
- Text Muted: rgba(255,255,255,0.40) — captions, timestamps, table headers
- Accent (iridescent, default): #22D3EE cyan → #818CF8 indigo → #E879F9 magenta, as linear-gradient(135deg, ...)
- Accent Glow: rgba(129,140,248,0.45) — the shadow color under lit elements
- Success: #34D399 on rgba(52,211,153,0.14) — settled, completed, active
- Warning: #FBBF24 on rgba(251,191,36,0.14) — pending, processing
- Error: #FB7185 on rgba(251,113,133,0.14) — failed, declined, fraud
- Info: #818CF8 on rgba(129,140,248,0.14) — in review, initiated

Alternate accent gradients: Emerald #34D399→#10B981→#06B6D4 · Cyan/blue #22D3EE→#3B82F6→#6366F1 · Violet #A78BFA→#8B5CF6→#D946EF · Gold #FCD34D→#F59E0B→#FB923C

## Typography

- Primary Font: Inter, or similar clean geometric sans — Geist, General Sans, SF Pro all work. One family only.
- Hero metric: 28–36px, weight 600, text-primary — the big balance number
- Card label: 12–13px, weight 500, text-secondary — sits above the metric
- Section title: 15–16px, weight 600, text-primary
- Card number: 22–26px, weight 500, letter-spaced — **** 8821 on the payment card
- Table cell: 13px, weight 400 · Table header: 11–12px, weight 500, text-muted, letter-spacing 0.04em
- Chip / meta: 11–12px, weight 500 (chip) or 400 (timestamps)
- Numbers: font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums everywhere. Always show currency symbol and correct decimals ($5,312.45). Deltas always signed and colored (+9.3% success, −2.4% error).

## Spacing & Layout

- Overall feel: Dense but calm — tight grid, generous breathing room inside each card
- Grid: 3-column bento. Hero card spans 2, KPI tiles fill the rest. Chart spans 2, actions panel 1. Transactions span 2, activity feed 1.
- Gap: 16px between cards
- Page padding: 16–24px
- Card padding: 20–22px
- Card internals: label at top → big number → chart/meta at bottom
- Mobile: Desktop dashboard is the default target; stack to single column when requested

## Borders & Radius

- Border radius: 20px cards, 18px payment card, 12–14px nested elements, 999px pills and chips. Never sharp corners.
- Borders: 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.08) on every glass surface — mandatory, cards disappear into the background without it
- Optional polish: box-shadow: inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.06) for a top-edge highlight that sells the glass

## Shadows & Elevation

- No hard drop shadows anywhere. Elevation comes from backdrop-filter: blur(20px) + low-opacity fill + 1px border.
- The only real shadow is the accent glow under lit elements: 0 8px 40px var(--accent-glow) on the payment card, drop-shadow(0 0 6px) on chart lines.

## Buttons

- Primary: Glass fill at 0.08, 1px border, pill or 12px radius, text-primary. Accent gradient reserved for the one promo tile and active toggles.
- Secondary / Ghost: Transparent, text-secondary, border brightens on hover
- Hover states: fill steps 0.04 → 0.06, border 0.08 → 0.14, 200ms ease
- Segmented control: pill group (5d · 15d · 60d) — inactive text-muted, active gets 0.08 fill and text-primary
- Toggle switch: off = glass track; on = accent gradient track with glow, white knob

## Icons

- Real SVG icon library only — Lucide (default), Heroicons, or Phosphor
- Thin line icons, 1.5px stroke, 20–24px, text-secondary default → text-primary on hover
- Never emojis — not in nav, buttons, status rows, feed items, or chips

## Components Spotted

- Payment card (hero): Iridescent holographic fill — cyan/indigo/magenta/emerald gradient layered over glass, 18px radius, 200px min-height, white 18% border, accent glow beneath. Slow diagonal sheen sweep on a 6s loop. Contents: brand mark + overlapping network circles → chip glyph → masked number → status chip + action ("Tap to lock").
- Glass card: rgba(255,255,255,0.04) + backdrop-filter: blur(20px) + 1px border + 20px radius + 20px padding. The base for every panel.
- KPI tile: Label → big number → tiny sparkline or progress bar
- Status chip: Pill, 4px/10px padding, 11px text, colored text on 14%-opacity matching background, small leading dot in currentColor
- Transactions table: checkbox · merchant/ID · amount (tabular, right-aligned) · status chip · date · expand chevron. Muted header row, 1px glass dividers, row hover lifts fill. Toolbar above: Sort, Filter, Copy ID, Export.
- Actions panel: Vertical rows — leading line icon, label, trailing chevron or toggle. One row may be disabled at reduced opacity.
-Activity feed: Status icon → title + subtitle → right-aligned timestamp
- Promo tile: The one element allowed to use the accent gradient as a fill — gradient wash + sparkle icon, slow shifting background position

## Data Visualization

- Area/line chart: 2px accent-gradient stroke with a soft glow filter, vertical fill fading from 18% accent to transparent, dashed muted reference line, glass tooltip chip with a glowing data dot
- Ring/donut: Glass track, accent-family segment hues, big number + label centered, legend rows with colored dot + tabular percentage
- Bars/sparklines: Accent gradient vertical fill, rounded tops, 6–10px wide; comparison bars in flat glass
- Chart globals: grid lines rgba(255,255,255,0.05), axis text muted at 11px, no chart borders — the glass card is the container

## Motion

- Card hover 200ms ease · payment card sheen 6s loop · KPI count-up ~600ms ease-out on load · chart line draw-in ~800ms · toggle knob 200ms with glow fade · tooltip fade + 6px slide 150ms · promo tile slow gradient shimmer
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion — kill sheen, count-up, and shimmer; keep static states

## Overall Replication Notes

- Every surface is a glass card. Every number is formatted. Every status is a chip. The iridescent card anchors the screen.
- Backdrop blur is non-negotiable — it's the entire reason the style reads as glass
- The neon gradient is a glow, not a fill — hero card, primary chart line, one promo tile, active toggles, focus rings. Nowhere else.
- Never solid opaque cards. Never bright solid-color blocks. Never pure black. Never sharp corners. Never hard shadows.
- Status colors are semantic only — green = done, amber = pending, rose = failed. Never decorative.
- Guard contrast: hero metrics stay at 95% white, muted text never sits on the lightest glass, chip text keeps full saturation, and the payment card gets a dark scrim behind text if the iridescence runs bright.
- Use realistic financial data — real merchant names, plausible amounts, varied statuses.
